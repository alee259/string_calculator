# String Calculator
This program was made to basically perform basic arithmetic on numbers too long to fit into C++'s largest variable, an unsigned long long int. 
Although it was originally desiged to take in two numbers from a file (due to their length), it can easily be adapted for user input instead by modifying some lines.

# Functions
So far, this string calculator can add, subtract, and multiply. Division has not yet been added.
